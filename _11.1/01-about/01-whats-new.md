### Foundational services a prerequisite for flexibility

{{site.data.reuse.icpfs}} is now a prerequisite. {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} supports {{site.data.reuse.fs}} version 3.19.0 or later 3.x releases, providing support for both the Continuous Delivery (CD) and the Long Term Service Release (LTSR) version of {{site.data.reuse.fs}} (for more information, see the [prerequisites](../../installing/prerequisites/#ibm-cloud-pak-foundational-services)).

### Simplified installation and upgrade processâ€¨

{{site.data.reuse.short_name}} 11.1.0 introduces automatic [upgrade](../../installing/upgrading) of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instances. The {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator deploys and manages only a single version of the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance. When upgrading {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}, the operator upgrades instances to the version supported by the operator, so you no longer have to upgrade the instances separately.

### Support for SCRAM authentication

{{site.data.reuse.short_name}} version 11.1.0 introduces support for SCRAM authentication access to the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI (for more information, see [configuring UI security](../../installing/configuring/#configuring-ui-security)). Kafka users that have been configured to use SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication can log in to the UI and access components based on the ACL permissions of the user.

**Note:** The following features are not available in this release of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} when using SCRAM authentication:
- Metrics information and dashboards
- Geo-replication
- {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} CLI

### Security and bug fixes
