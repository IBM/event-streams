Upgrade your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} installation as follows. The {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator handles the upgrade of your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance.

## Upgrade paths

Understand the upgrade paths available for Continuous Delivery (CD) releases and Extended Update Support (EUS) releases.

### Upgrade paths for CD releases

You can upgrade {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} to the latest 11.1.6 version directly from any 11.1.x or 11.0.x version by using operator version 3.1.6. If you have an earlier {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} version than 11.0.x, you must first upgrade it to [version 11.0.x](../../11.0/installing/upgrading/) before upgrading to 11.1.x.

**Note:** If your operator upgrades are set to automatic, minor version upgrades are completed automatically. This means that the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator is upgraded to 3.1.6 when it is available in the catalog, and your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance is then also automatically upgraded, unless you [set a schedule for the upgrade](#scheduling-the-upgrade-of-an-instance) by pausing the reconciliation.

### Upgrade paths for EUS releases

No direct upgrade from EUS to the latest version is supported. Upgrade to [CD version 11.0.x](../../11.0/installing/upgrading/) and then proceed to upgrade your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} version to the latest by following the instructions on this page starting with the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) (operator version 3.1.6).

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have followed the [upgrade steps for {{site.data.reuse.cp4i}}](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2022.4?topic=upgrading){:target="_blank"} before upgrading {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}.

- The images for {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} release 11.1.x are available in the IBM Cloud Container Registry. Ensure you redirect your catalog source to use `icr.io/cpopen` as described in [Implementing ImageContentSourcePolicy to redirect to the IBM Container Registry](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/1.0?topic=clusters-migrating-from-docker-container-registry#implementing-imagecontentsourcepolicy-to-redirect-to-the-ibm-container-registry){:target="_blank"}.


- To upgrade successfully, your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance must have more than one ZooKeeper node or have persistent storage enabled. If you upgrade an {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance with a single ZooKeeper node that has ephemeral storage, all messages and all topics will be lost and both ZooKeeper and Kafka pods will move to an error state. To avoid this issue, increase the number of ZooKeeper nodes before upgrading as follows:


   ```yaml
   apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
   kind: EventStreams
   metadata:
     name: example-pre-upgrade
     namespace: myproject
   spec:
     strimziOverrides:
       zookeeper:
         replicas: 3
   ```

- If you [installed the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator](../installing/#install-the-event-streams-operator) to manage instances of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} in any namespace (one per namespace), then you might need to control when each of these instances is upgraded to the latest version. You can control the updates by pausing the reconciliation of the instance configuration as described in the following sections.

### Scheduling the upgrade of an instance

In 11.1.x and later, the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator handles the upgrade of your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance automatically after the operator is upgraded. No additional step is required to change the instance (product) version.

If your operator manages more than one instance of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}, you can control when each instance is upgraded by pausing the reconciliation of the configuration settings for each instance, running the upgrade, and then unpausing the reconciliation when ready to proceed with the upgrade for a selected instance.

#### Pausing reconciliation by using the UI

1. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_ui_login}}
2. Expand **Operators** in the navigation on the left, and click **Installed Operators**.

   ![Operators > Installed Operators]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/rhocp_menu_installedoperators.png "Screen capture showing how to select Operators > Installed Operators from navigation menu"){:height="50%" width="50%"}

3. From the **Project** list, select the namespace (project) the instance is installed in.
4. Locate the operator that manages your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance in the namespace. It is called **{{site.data.reuse.long_name}}** in the **Name** column. Click the **{{site.data.reuse.long_name}}** link in the row.
5. Select the instance you want to pause and click the `YAML` tab.
6. In the `YAML` for the custom resource, add `eventstreams.ibm.com/pause-reconciliation: 'true'` to the `metadata.annotations` field as follows:

    ```
    apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta2
    kind: EventStreams
    metadata:
      name: <instance-name>
      namespace: <instance-namespace>
      annotations:
        eventstreams.ibm.com/pause-reconciliation: 'true'
    ```

7. This annotation also needs to be applied to the corresponding `Kafka` custom resource. Expand **Home** in the navigation on the left,  click **API Explorer**, and type `Kafka` in the `Filter by kind...` field. Select `Kafka`.
8. From the **Project** list, select the namespace (project) the instance is installed in and click the **Instances** tab.
9. Select the instance with the name `<instance-name>` (the same as the {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} instance).
10. In the `YAML` for the custom resource, add `eventstreams.ibm.com/pause-reconciliation: 'true'` to the `metadata.annotations` field as follows:

    ```
    apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta2
    kind: Kafka
    metadata:
      name: <instance-name>
      namespace: <instance-namespace>
      annotations:
        eventstreams.ibm.com/pause-reconciliation: 'true'
    ```

11. Follow the steps to upgrade by using [the UI](#upgrading-by-using-the-ui) or [the CLI](#upgrading-by-using-the-cli).
12. To unpause the reconciliation and continue with the upgrade of an {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance, first remove the annotations from the `Kafka` custom resource, and then from the `EventStreams` custom resource. When the annotations are removed, the configuration of your instance is updated, and the upgrade to the latest version of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} completes.


#### Pausing reconciliation by using the CLI

1. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
2. To apply the annotation first to the `EventStreams` and then to the `Kafka` custom resource, run the following command, where `<type>` is either `EventStreams` or `Kafka`:

   `oc annotate <type> <instance-name> -n <instance-namespace> eventstreams.ibm.com/pause-reconciliation='true'`

3. Follow the steps to upgrade by using [the UI](#upgrading-by-using-the-ui) or [the CLI](#upgrading-by-using-the-cli).
4. To unpause the reconciliation and continue with the upgrade of an {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance, run the following command to first remove the annotations from the `Kafka` custom resource, and then from the `EventStreams` custom resource, where `<type>` is either `Kafka` or `EventStreams`:

   `oc annotate <type> <instance-name> -n <instance-namespace> eventstreams.ibm.com/pause-reconciliation-`

   When the annotations are removed, the configuration of your instance is updated, and the upgrade to the latest version of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} completes.


## Upgrading by using the UI

If you are using the OpenShift Container Platform web console, complete the steps in the following sections to upgrade your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} installation.


1. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_ui_login}}
2. Expand **Operators** in the navigation on the left, and click **Installed Operators**.\\
   ![Operators > Installed Operators]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/rhocp_menu_installedoperators.png "Screen capture showing how to select Operators > Installed Operators from navigation menu"){:height="50%" width="50%"}
3. From the **Project** list, select the namespace (project) the instance is installed in.
4. Locate the operator that manages your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance in the namespace. It is called **{{site.data.reuse.long_name}}** in the **Name** column. Click the **{{site.data.reuse.long_name}}** link in the row.
4. Click the **Subscription** tab to display the **Subscription details** for the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator.
5. Click the version number link in the **Update channel** section (for example, **v3.0**). The **Change Subscription update channel** dialog is displayed, showing the channels that are available to upgrade to.
6. Select **v3.1** and click the **Save** button on the **Change Subscription Update Channel** dialog.

   **Important:** If you receive a warning message similar to the following in the status, remove it by changing the value of the `spec.version` field to `latest` in the YAML file:

   ```
   Invalid value '11.0.4' set for spec.version. Your instance will be reconciled as 'latest', the only valid value for spec.version. Ensure you set spec.version to 'latest'.
   ```
All {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} pods that need to be updated as part of the upgrade will be gracefully rolled. Where required, ZooKeeper pods will roll one at a time, followed by Kafka brokers rolling one at a time.

**Note:** The number of containers in each Kafka broker will reduce from 2 to 1 as the TLS-sidecar container will be removed from each broker during the upgrade process.

<!--- Alternative steps for PlatformUI to be added. Sounds like CP4I donâ€™t support our latest setting in this release, but might do in the next (or later).-->


## Upgrading by using the CLI

If you are using the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), the `oc` command, complete the steps in the following sections to upgrade your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} installation.

1. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
2. Ensure the required {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} Operator Upgrade Channel is available:

   `oc get packagemanifest ibm-eventstreams -o=jsonpath='{.status.channels[*].name}'`

2. Change the subscription to move to the required update channel, where `vX.Y` is the required update channel (for example, `v3.0`):

   `oc patch subscription -n <namespace> ibm-eventstreams --patch '{"spec":{"channel":"vX.Y"}}' --type=merge`

   **Important:** You might receive a warning message similar to the following in the status:
   ```
   Invalid value '11.0.4' set for spec.version. Your instance will be reconciled as 'latest', the only valid value for spec.version. Ensure you set spec.version to 'latest'.
   ```
   To remove the warning, change the `spec.version` to `latest` by entering the following command:

   `oc patch eventstreams -n <namespace> <name-of-the-es-instance> --patch '{"spec":{"version":"latest"}}' --type=merge`


All {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} pods that need to be updated as part of the upgrade will be gracefully rolled. Where required, ZooKeeper pods will roll one at a time, followed by Kafka brokers rolling one at a time.


## Verifying the upgrade

1. Wait for all {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} pods to complete the upgrade process. This is indicated by the `Running` state.
2. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
3. To retrieve a list of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instances, run the following command:

   `oc get eventstreams -n <namespace>`

4. For the instance of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} that you upgraded, check that the status returned by the following command is `Ready`.

   `oc get eventstreams -n <namespace> <name-of-the-es-instance> -o jsonpath="'{.status.phase}'"`

5. To check the version of your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance, run the following command:

   `oc get eventstreams -n <namespace> <name-of-the-es-instance> -o jsonpath="'{.status.versions.reconciled}'"`


## Post-upgrade tasks

### Enable collection of producer metrics

In {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} version 11.0.0 and later, a Kafka Proxy handles gathering metrics from producing applications. The information is displayed in the [**Producers** dashboard](../../administering/topic-health/). The proxy is optional and is not enabled by default. To enable metrics gathering and have the information displayed in the dashboard, [enable the Kafka Proxy](../../installing/configuring/#enabling-collection-of-producer-metrics).

### Enable metrics for monitoring

To display metrics in the monitoring dashboards of the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI, ensure you [enable](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2022.4?topic=administering-enabling-openshift-container-platform-monitoring){:target="_blank"} the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} monitoring stack.

### Migrate to latest Apicurio Registry

![Event Streams 11.1.6 icon]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/11.1.6.svg "In Event Streams 11.1.6")Apicurio client libraries versions 2.3.1 and earlier use a [date format that is not compatible](../../troubleshooting/upgrade-apicurio) with Apicurio Registry server versions 2.4.1 or later. Apicurio Registry is only deployed when you update the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} custom resource to use the latest version of Apicurio Registry included with {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}.

Migrate your schema registry to use the latest Apicurio Registry as follows:

1. Ensure all applications connecting to your instance of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} that use the schema registry are using Apicurio client libraries version 2.4.1 or later before migrating.
2. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
3. Add the `eventstreams.ibm.com/apicurio-registry-version='>=2.4'` annotation to your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} custom resource with the following command:
   ```shell
   oc annotate --namespace <namespace> EventStreams <instance-name> eventstreams.ibm.com/apicurio-registry-version='>=2.4'
      ```

The {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator will update your schema registry to use the latest version of Apicurio Registry included with {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}.
