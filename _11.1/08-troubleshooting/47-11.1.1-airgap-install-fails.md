## Symptoms

When following the instructions to install {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} 11.1.1 in an air-gapped environment, the step where images are mirrored fails with the following error:
```
error: unable to retrieve source image icr.io/cpopen/ibm-eventstreams-catalog manifest sha256:1fd01b60a879719996abff8916f8afe8f3978a602bdba7d28fb3fa9073ef3498: manifest unknown: OCI index found, but accept header does not support OCI indexes
error: an error occurred during planning
```

## Causes

The mirroring step fails because some of the images uploaded in the 11.1.1 release of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} are not in a suitable format for mirroring.

## Resolving the problem

[Upgrade](../../installing/upgrading/) your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance to version 11.1.3 or later to resolve the issue.
