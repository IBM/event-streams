Accessibility features assist users who have a disability, such as restricted mobility or limited vision, to use information technology content successfully.

## Overview

{{site.data.reuse.long_name}} includes the following major accessibility features:

-   Keyboard-only operation
-   Operations that use a screen reader

{{site.data.reuse.long_name}} uses the latest W3C Standard, [WAI-ARIA 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), to ensure compliance with [US Section 508](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards/section-508-standards) and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). To take advantage of accessibility features, use the latest release of your screen reader and the latest web browser that is supported by {{site.data.reuse.long_name}}.


## Keyboard navigation

This product uses standard navigation keys.


## Interface information

The {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} user interfaces do not have content that flashes 2 - 55 times per second.

The {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} web user interface relies on cascading style sheets to render content properly and to provide a usable experience. The application provides an equivalent way for low-vision users to use system display settings, including high-contrast mode. You can control font size by using the device or web browser settings.

The {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} web user interface includes WAI-ARIA navigational landmarks that you can use to quickly navigate to functional areas in the application.
