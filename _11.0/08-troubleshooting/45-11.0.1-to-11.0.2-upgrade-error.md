## Symptoms

When upgrading from {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} 11.0.1, some pods might display an `ImagePullBackOff` error status after the operator is upgraded to 3.0.2.

## Causes

The 3.0.2 operator is looking for an incorrect set of images to apply to the 11.0.1 instance. This means it is trying to roll the pods but the new images cannot be found.

## Resolving the problem

To resolve the errors, continue with upgrading the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance (operand) version to 11.0.2 as described in [upgrading and migrating](../../installing/upgrading).
