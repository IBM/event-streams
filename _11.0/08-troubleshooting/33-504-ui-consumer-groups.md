## Symptoms
When viewing consumer groups in the Event Streams UI, the page displays a loading indicator while it fetches the groups. However, the groups are not displayed and a 504 timeout error is shown instead.

## Causes
As the number of consumer groups increases it will reach a limit where the service that retrieves the groups for the UI is unable to respond before the UI considers the request to have timed out.
