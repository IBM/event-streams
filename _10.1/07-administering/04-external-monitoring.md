You can use third-party monitoring tools to monitor the deployed {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} Kafka cluster by connecting to the JMX port on the Kafka brokers and reading Kafka metrics.

You must [configure](../../installing/configuring/#configuring-external-monitoring-through-jmx) your installation to set up access for external monitoring tools.

For examples about setting up monitoring with external tools such as Datadog, Prometheus, and Splunk, see the [tutorials](../../tutorials/) page.

If you have a tool or service you want to use to monitor your clusters, you can [raise a request](../../support/#suggest-a-feature).
