When you have geo-replication set up, you can monitor and manage your geo-replication, such as checking the status of your geo-replicators, pausing and resuming geo-replication, removing replicated topics from destination clusters, and so on.

## From a destination cluster

You can check the status of your geo-replication and manage geo-replicators (such as pause and resume) on your destination cluster.

You can view the following information for geo-replication on a destination cluster:

* The total number of origin clusters that have topics being replicated to the destination cluster you are logged into.
* The total number of topics being geo-replicated to the destination cluster you are logged into.
* Information about each origin cluster that has geo-replication set up on the destination cluster you are logged into:
    - The cluster name, which includes the release name.
    - The health of the geo-replication for that origin cluster: **Creating**, **Running**, **Updating**, **Paused**, **Stopping**, **Assigning**, **Offline**, and **Error**.
    - Number of topics replicated from each origin cluster.

**Tip:** As your cluster can be used as a destination for more than one origin cluster and their replicated topics, this information is useful to understand the status of all geo-replicators running on the cluster.

### Using the UI

To view this information on the destination cluster by using the UI:
1. Log in to your destination {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} cluster as an administrator.
2. Click **Topics** in the primary navigation and then click **Geo-replication**.
3. Click the **Origin locations** tab for details.

To manage geo-replication on the destination cluster by using the UI:
1. Log in to your destination {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} cluster as an administrator.
2. Click **Topics** in the primary navigation and then click **Geo-replication**.
3. Click the **Origin locations** tab for details.
4. Locate the name of the origin cluster for which you want to manage geo-replication for, and choose from one of the following options:
    - ![More options icon](../../images/more_options.png "Three vertical dots for the more options icon at end of each row."){:height="30px" width="15px"} **More options > Pause running replicators**: To pause geo-replication and suspend replication of data from the origin cluster.
    - ![More options icon](../../images/more_options.png "Three vertical dots for the more options icon at end of each row."){:height="30px" width="15px"} **More options > Resume paused replicators**: To resume geo-replication and restart replication of data from the origin cluster.
    - ![More options icon](../../images/more_options.png "Three vertical dots for the more options icon at end of each row."){:height="30px" width="15px"} **More options > Restart failed replicators**: To restart a geo-replicator that experienced problems.
    - ![More options icon](../../images/more_options.png "Three vertical dots for the more options icon at end of each row."){:height="30px" width="15px"} **More options > Stop replication**: To stop geo-replication from the origin cluster.\\
      **Important:** Stopping replication also removes the origin cluster from the list.

**Note**: You cannot perform these actions on the destination cluster by using the CLI.

## From an origin cluster

On the origin cluster, you can check the status of all of your destination clusters, and drill down into more detail about each destination.

You can also manage geo-replicators (such as pause and resume), and remove entire destination clusters as a target for geo-replication. You can also add topics to geo-replicate.

You can view the following high-level information for geo-replication on an origin cluster:

* The name of each destination cluster.
* The total number of topics being geo-replicated to all destination clusters from the origin cluster you are logged into.
* The total number of workers running for the destination cluster you are geo-replicating topics to.

You can view more detailed information about each destination cluster after they are set up and running like:

* The topics that are being geo-replicated to the destination cluster.
* The health status of the geo-replication on each destination cluster: **Awaiting creation**, **Pending**, **Running**, **Resume**, **Resuming**, **Pausing**, **Paused**, **Removing**, and **Error**. When the status is **Error**, the cause of the problem is also provided to aid resolution.

### Using the CLI

To view this information on the origin cluster by using the CLI:
1. Go to your origin cluster. {{site.data.reuse.cp_cli_login}}
2. {{site.data.reuse.es_cli_init}}
3. Retrieve destination cluster IDs by using the following command:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-clusters`
4. Retrieve information about a destination cluster by running the following command and copying the required destination cluster ID from the previous step:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-cluster --destination <destination-cluster-id>`\\
   For example:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-cluster --destination destination_byl6x`\\
   The command returns the following information:

   ```
   Details of destination cluster destination_byl6x
      Cluster ID          Cluster name   REST API URL                                                                     Skip SSL validation?
      destination_byl6x   destination    https://destination-ibm-es-admapi-external-myproject.apps.geodest.ibm.com:443    false

      Geo-replicator details
      Geo-replicator name                                             Status          Origin bootstrap servers
      origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector       RUNNING         origin_es-kafka-bootstrap-myproject.apps.geosource.ibm.com:443
      origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorCheckpointConnector   RUNNING         origin_es-kafka-bootstrap-myproject.apps.geosource.ibm.com:443

      Geo-replicated topics
      Geo-replicator name                                             Origin topic    Destination topic
      origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector       topic1          origin_es.topic1
      origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector       topic2          origin_es.topic2
      origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorCheckpointConnector   topic1          origin_es.topic1
      origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorCheckpointConnector   topic2          origin_es.topic2

   ```

The MirrorSource connector replicates data from the origin to the destination cluster. You can use the MirrorCheckpoint connector during [failover](../failover/#updating-consumer-group-offsets-by-using-checkpoints) from the origin to the destination cluster.

To manage geo-replication on the origin cluster by using the CLI:
1. Go to your origin cluster. {{site.data.reuse.cp_cli_login}}
2. {{site.data.reuse.es_cli_init}}
3. Run the following commands as required:\\

  - `cloudctl es geo-replicator-pause --destination <destination-cluster-id> --name "<replicator-name>"`\\
     For example:\\
     `cloudctl es geo-replicator-pause --destination destination_byl6x  --name "origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector "`\\
     This will pause both the MirrorSource connector and the MirrorCheckpoint connector for this geo-replicator.  Geo-replication for all topics that are part of this geo-replicator will be paused.

  - `cloudctl es geo-replicator-resume --destination <destination-cluster-id> --name "<replicator-name>"`\\
   For example:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-replicator-resume --destination destination_byl6x  --name "origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector "`\\
   This will resume both the MirrorSource connector and the MirrorCheckpoint connector for this geo-replicator after they have been paused. Geo-replication for all topics that are part of this geo-replicator will be resumed.

  - `cloudctl es geo-replicator-restart --destination <destination-cluster-id> --name "<replicator-name>"`\\
   For example:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-replicator-restart --destination destination_byl6x  --name "origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector "`\\
   This will restart a failed geo-replicator.

  - `cloudctl es geo-replicator-topics-remove --destination <destination-cluster-id> --name "<replicator-name>" --topics <comma-separated-topic-list>`\\
    For example:\\
    `cloudctl es geo-replicator-topics-remove --destination destination_byl6x  --name "origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector " --topics topic1,topic2`\\
    This will remove the listed topics from this geo-replicator.

  - `cloudctl es geo-replicator-delete --destination <destination-cluster-id> --name "<replicator-name>"`\\
   For example:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-replicator-delete --destination destination_byl6x  --name "origin_es->destination-mm2connector.MirrorSourceConnector "`\\
   This will remove all MirrorSource and MirrorCheckpoint connectors for this geo-replicator.


  - `cloudctl es geo-cluster-remove --destination <destination-cluster-id>`\\
   For example:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-cluster-remove --destination destination_byl6x`\\
   This will permanently remove a destination cluster.\\
   **Note:** If you are unable to remove a destination cluster due to technical issues, you can use the `--force` option with the `geo-cluster-remove` command to remove the cluster.


## Restarting a geo-replicator with Error status

Running geo-replicators constantly consume from origin clusters and produce to destination clusters. If the geo-replicator receives an unexpected error from Kafka, it might stop replicating and report a status of **Error**.

Monitor your geo-replication cluster to confirm that your geo-replicator is replicating data.

To restart a geo-replicator that has an **Error** status from the UI:
1. Log in to your origin {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} cluster as an administrator.
2. Click **Topics** in the primary navigation and then click **Geo-replication**.
3. Locate the name of the destination cluster for the geo-replicator that has an **Error** status.
4. Locate the reason for the **Error** status under the entry for the geo-replicator.
5. Either fix the reported problem with the system or verify that the problem is no longer present.
6. Select ![More options icon](../../images/more_options.png "Three vertical dots for the more options icon at the top right of the destination cluster window."){:height="30px" width="15px"} **More options > Restart failed replicator** to restart the geo-replicator.

## Using Grafana dashboards to monitor geo-replication

Metrics are useful indicators of the health of geo-replication.  They can give warnings of potential problems as well as providing data that can be used to alert on outages. Monitor the health of your geo-replicator using the available metrics to ensure replication continues.

Configure your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} geo-replicator to export metrics, and then view them using the example [Grafana dashboard](http://ibm.biz/es-grafana-dashboards).


### Configuring metrics

Enable export of metrics in {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} geo-replication by editing the associated KafkaMirrorMaker2 custom resource.

#### Using the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} web console

1. Go to where your destination cluster is installed. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_ui_login}}
2. From the navigation menu, click **Operators > Installed Operators**.
3. In the **Projects** dropdown list, select the project that contains the destination {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} instance.
4. Select the **{{site.data.reuse.long_name}}** Operator in the list of Installed Operators.
5. Click the **Kafka Mirror Maker 2** tab to see the list of KafkaMirrorMaker2 instances.
6. Click the KafkaMirrorMaker2 instance with the name of the instance that you are adding metrics to.
7. Click the **YAML** tab.
8. Add the `spec.metrics` property. For example:

    ```
    # ...
    spec:
      metrics: {}
    # ...
    ```
9. Click **Save**.


#### Using the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} CLI

To modify the number of geo-replicator workers run the following using the oc tool:
1. Go to where your destination cluster is installed. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
2. Run the following command to select the project that contains the existing destination cluster:\\
   `oc project <project-name>`
3. Run the following command to list your `KafkaMirrorMaker2` instances:\\
   `oc get kafkamirrormaker2s`
4. Run the following command to edit the custom resource for your `KafkaMirrorMaker2` instance:\\
   `oc edit kafkamirrormaker2 <instance-name>`
5. Add the `spec.metrics` property. For example:

   ```
   spec:
     metrics: {}
   ```
6. Save your changes and close the editor.


### Installing persistent Grafana dashboards

{{site.data.reuse.icpcs}} does not currently have a way to configure persistent storage on Grafana. This means that when the Grafana pods get restarted, you will lose any data on Grafana.

To install {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} Grafana dashboards that will persist, use the following steps:

1. Download the geo-replication `MonitoringDashboard` custom resource from [GitHub](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-operator-resources/tree/master/grafana-dashboards).
2. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
3. Apply the `MonitoringDashboard` custom resource as follows:

   `oc apply -f <dashboard-path> -n <namespace>`


### Viewing installed Grafana dashboards

To view the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} Grafana dashboards, follow these steps:

1. {{site.data.reuse.icpcs_ui_login}}
2. Navigate to the {{site.data.reuse.icpcs}} console homepage.
3. Click the hamburger icon in the top left.
4. Expand **Monitor Health**.
5. Click the **Monitoring** in the expanded menu to open the Grafana homepage.
6. Click the user icon in the bottom left corner to open the user profile page.
7. In the **Organizations** table, find the namespace where you installed the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} geo-replication `MonitoringDashboard` custom resource, and switch the user profile to that namespace. If you have not installed persistent dashboards, follow the instructions for [installing persistent Grafana dashboards](#installing-persistent-grafana-dashboards).
8. Hover the **Dashboards** on the left and click **Manage**.
9. Click on the dashboard to view the **Dashboard** table.

Ensure you select your namespace, cluster name, and other filters at the top of the dashboard to view the required information.
