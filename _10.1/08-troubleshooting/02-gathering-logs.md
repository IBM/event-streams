To help IBM Support troubleshoot any issues with your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} instance, use the `oc adm must-gather` command to capture the [must gather logs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/support/gathering-cluster-data.html). The logs are stored in a folder in the current working directory.

To gather diagnostic logs, run the following commands as Cluster Administrator:

1. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
2. Run the following command to capture the logs:

   `oc adm must-gather --image=ibmcom/ibm-eventstreams-must-gather -- gather -m eventstreams -n <namespace>`

To gather system level diagnostics in addition to the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} information:

1. {{site.data.reuse.openshift_cli_login}}
2. Run the following command to capture the logs:

   `oc adm must-gather --image=ibmcom/ibm-eventstreams-must-gather -- gather -m system,eventstreams -n <namespace>`

These logs are stored in an archive file in a folder in the current working directory.
For example, the must-gather archive could be located on the path:
```
must-gather.local.6409880158745169979/docker-io-ibmcom-ibm-eventstreams-must-gather-sha256-23a438c8f46037a72b5378b29decad00e871d11f19834ba75b149326847e7c05/cloudpak-must-gather-20200624100001.tgz
```
