## Symptoms

When trying to remove an offline geo-replication destination cluster, the following error message is displayed in the UI:

```
Failed to retrieve data for this destination cluster.
```

## Causes

There could be several reasons, for example, the cluster might be offline, or the service ID of the cluster might have been revoked.

## Resolving the problem

1. Go to your origin cluster. {{site.data.reuse.cp_cli_login}}
2. Run the following command to start the {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} CLI: `cloudctl es init`
3. Retrieve destination cluster IDs by using the following command:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-clusters`\\
   Look for the destination cluster ID that you want to remove.
4. Run the following command:\\
   `cloudctl es geo-cluster-remove --destination <destination-cluster-id> --force`
