2. Click **Workloads > Helm Releases** from the navigation menu.
3. Locate the release name of your installation in the **Name** column, and click ![More options icon](../../../images/more_options.png "Three vertical dots for the more options icon at end of each row."){:height="30px" width="15px"} **More options > Delete** in the corresponding row.
4. Optional: If you enabled persistence during installation, you also need to manually remove  [PersistentVolumes](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.1/manage_cluster/delete_volume.html) and [PersistentVolumeClaims](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.1/manage_cluster/delete_app_volume.html).
