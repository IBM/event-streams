## Enabling persistent storage

Set persistent storage for Kafka and ZooKeeper in your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} installation.

To enable persistent storage for Kafka:
1. Go to the [**Kafka persistent storage settings**](#kafka-persistent-storage-settings) section.
2. Select the **Enable persistent storage for Apache Kafka** check box.
3. Optional: Select the **Use dynamic provisioning for Apache Kafka** check box and provide a storage class name if the Persistent Volumes will be created dynamically.

To enable persistent storage for ZooKeeper:
1. Go to the [**ZooKeeper settings**](#zookeeper-settings) section.
2. Select the **Enable persistent storage for ZooKeeper servers** check box.
3. Optional: Select the **Use dynamic provisioning for ZooKeeper servers** check box and provide a storage class name if the Persistent Volumes will be created dynamically.

## Specifying a ConfigMap for Kafka configuration

If you have a ConfigMap for Kafka configuration settings, you can provide it to your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} installation to use. Enter the name in the **Cluster configuration ConfigMap** field of the [**Kafka broker settings**](#kafka-broker-settings) section.

**Important**: The ConfigMap must be in the same namespace as where you intend to install the {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} release.

## Setting geo-replication nodes

When installing {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} as an instance intended for geo-replication, configure the number of geo-replication worker nodes in the **[Geo-replication settings](#geo-replication-settings)** section by setting the number of nodes required in the **Geo-replicator workers** field.

**Note:** If you want to set up a cluster as a destination for geo-replication, ensure you set a minimum of 2 nodes for high availability reasons.

[Consider the number of geo-replication nodes](../../georeplication/planning/#preparing-destination-clusters) to run on a destination cluster. You can also set up destination clusters and configure the number of geo-replication worker nodes for an existing installation later.

## Configuring external access

By default, external Kafka client applications connect to the {{site.data.reuse.icp}} master node directly without any configuration required. You simply leave the **External hostname/IP address** field of the [**External access settings**](#external-access-settings) section blank.

If you want clients to connect through a different route such as a load balancer, use the field to specify the host name or IP address of the endpoint.

Also ensure you configure security for your cluster by setting certificate details in the [**Secure connection settings**](#secure-connection-settings) section. By default, a self-signed certificate is created during installation and the **Private key**, **TLS certificate**, and **CA certificate** fields can be left blank. If you want to use an existing certificate, select **provided** under **Certificate type**, and provide these additional keys and certificate values as base 64-encoded strings. Alternatively, you can [**generate your own certificates**](#generating-your-own-certificates).

<!--
When installing by using the CLI, add the `proxy.externalEndpoint=<external-ip-address-or-hostname>` value to the Helm install command, and set the values for secure connections. For more information, see the README.
-->

After installation, [set up external access](../post-installation/#connecting-clients) by checking the port number to use for external connections and ensuring the necessary certificates are configured within your client environment.

## Configuration reference

Configure your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} installation by setting the following parameters as needed.

### Global install settings

The following table describes the parameters for setting global installation options.

Field  | Description   | Default

**Note:** The data gathered helps IBM understand how {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} is used, and can help build knowledge about typical deployment scenarios and common user preferences. The aim is to improve the overall user experience, and the data could influence decisions about future enhancements. For example, information about the configuration options used the most often could help IBM provide better default values for making the installation process easier. The data is only used by IBM and is not shared outside of IBM.<br />If you enable analytics, but want to opt out later, or want more information, [contact us](mailto:eventstreams@uk.ibm.com).

## Generating your own certificates

You can create your own certificates for configuring external access. When prompted, answer all questions with the appropriate information.

1. Create the certificate to use for the Certificate Authority (CA):\\
   `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ca.key -x509 -days 365 -out ca.pem`
2. Generate a RSA 2048-bit private key:\\
     `openssl genrsa -out es.key 2048`\\
     Other key lengths and algorithms are also supported. See the following lists for supported cipher suites.\\
     **Note:** In the following lists, the string "TLS" is interchangeable with "SSL" and vice versa. For example, where TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA is specified, SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA also applies. For more information about each cipher suite, go to the  [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) site](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xml) and search for the selected cipher suite ID.

     ![Event Streams 2018.3.1 icon](../../../images/2018.3.1.svg "In Event Streams 2018.3.1.") In {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} 2018.3.1, the following cipher suites are supported, using TLS 1.2 and later only:
     - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
     - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

     ![Event Streams 2018.3.0 icon](../../../images/2018.3.0.svg "In Event Streams 2018.3.0.") In {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} 2018.3.0, the following cipher suites are supported:
     - TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
     - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
     - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
     - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
     - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
     - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

3. Create a certificate signing request for the key generated in the previous step:\\
   `openssl req -new -key es.key -out es.csr`
4. Sign the request with the CA certificate created in step 1:\\
   `openssl x509 -req -in es.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out es.pem`
5. Encode your generated file to a base64 string. This can be done using command line tools such as base64, for example, to encode the file created in step 1:\\
   `cat ca.pem | base64 > ca.b64`

Completing these steps creates the following files which, after being encoded to a base64 string, can be used to configure your installation:

1. **ca.pem** : CA public certificate
2. **es.pem** : Release public certificate
3. **es.key** : Release private key
