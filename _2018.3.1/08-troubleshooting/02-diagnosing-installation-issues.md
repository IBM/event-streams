![Event Streams 2018.3.1 icon](../../../images/2018.3.1.svg "In Event Streams 2018.3.1.") To help troubleshoot and resolve installation issues, you can run a diagnostic script that checks your deployment for potential problems.

**Important:** Do not use the script before the installation process completes. Despite a successful installation message, some processes might still need to complete, and it can take up to 10 minutes before {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} is available to use.

To run the script:

1. Download the `installation-diagnostic-script.sh` script from [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/event-streams/tree/master/support){:target="_blank"}.
2. Ensure you have installed the Kubernetes command line tool and the {{site.data.reuse.icp}} CLI as noted in the [installation prerequisites](../../installing/prerequisites/).
3. {{site.data.reuse.icp_cli_login}}
4. Run the script as follows:\\
    `./installation-diagnostic-script.sh -n <namespace> -r <release-name>`

If you have been waiting for more than an hour, add the `--restartoldpods` option to recreate lost events (by default, events are deleted after an hour). This option restarts **Failed** or **Pending** pods that are an hour old or more.

For example, the following installation has pods that are in pending state, and running the diagnostic script reveals that the issue is caused by not having sufficient memory and CPU resources available to the pods:
