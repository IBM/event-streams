## Symptoms

When running the `cloudctl es` command, the following error message is displayed:

```
FAILED
...
```

## Causes

This error occurs when you have not logged in to the {{site.data.reuse.icp}} cluster and initialized the command line tool.

## Resolving the problem

Ensure you log in to the {{site.data.reuse.icp}} cluster as follows:

```
cloudctl login -a https://<Cluster Master Host>:<Cluster Master API Port>
```

After logging in to {{site.data.reuse.icp}}, initialize the {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} CLI as follows:

cloudctl es init
```

Finally, run the operation again.
