Monitoring the health of your Kafka cluster ensures your operations run smoothly. {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} collects metrics from all of the Kafka brokers and exports them to a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/){:target="_blank"}-based monitoring platform. The metrics are useful indicators of the health of the cluster, and can provide warnings of potential problems.

You can use the metrics as follows:
- View a selection of metrics on a preconfigured [dashboard](#viewing-the-preconfigured-dashboard) in the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI.
- Create dashboards in the Grafana service that is provided in {{site.data.reuse.icp}}. You can download example Grafana dashboards for {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} from [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/event-streams/tree/master/support/dashboards/grafana){:target="_blank"}.

   For more information about the monitoring capabilities provided in {{site.data.reuse.icp}}, including Grafana, see the {{site.data.reuse.icp}} [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.2/manage_metrics/monitoring_service.html){:target="_blank"}.
- Create alerts so that metrics that meet predefined criteria are used to send notifications to emails, Slack, PagerDuty, and so on. For an example of how to use the metrics to trigger alert notifications, see how you can set up [notifications to Slack](../../../tutorials/monitoring-alerts/).
