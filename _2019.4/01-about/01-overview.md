{{site.data.reuse.long_name}} is an event-streaming platform based on the open-source Apache Kafka® project.

{{site.data.reuse.short_name}} version 2019.4.1 includes Kafka release 2.3.0, and supports the use of all Kafka interfaces.

{{site.data.reuse.short_name}} versions 2019.4.2, 2019.4.3 and 2019.4.4 include Kafka release 2.3.1, and support the use of all Kafka interfaces.

{{site.data.reuse.long_name}} builds upon the {{site.data.reuse.icp}} platform to deploy Apache Kafka in a resilient and manageable way. It includes a UI design aimed at application developers getting started with Apache Kafka, as well as users operating a production cluster.

{{site.data.reuse.long_name}} features include:

* Apache Kafka deployment that maximizes the spread of Kafka brokers across the nodes of the {{site.data.reuse.icp}} cluster. This creates a highly-available configuration making the deployment resilient to many classes of failure with automatic restart of brokers included.
* Health check information and options to resolve issues with your clusters and brokers.
* Geo-replication of your topics between clusters to enable disaster recovery and scalability.
* UI for browsing messages to help view and filter hundreds of thousands of messages, including options to drill in and see message details from a set time.
* Encrypted communication between internal components and encrypted storage by using features available in {{site.data.reuse.icp}}.
* Security with authentication and authorization using {{site.data.reuse.icp}}.
