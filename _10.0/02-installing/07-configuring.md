{{site.data.reuse.short_name}} provides samples to help you get started with deployments, as described in the [planning](../planning/#sample-deployments) section. Choose one of the samples suited to your requirements to get started:

- Lightweight without security
- Development
- Minimal production
- Production 3 brokers
- Production 6 brokers
- Production 9 brokers

You can modify the samples, save them, and apply custom configuration settings as well. See the following sections for guidance about configuring your instance of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}.

**Note:** The **Production 6 brokers** and **Production 9 brokers** samples are only available on [GitHub](http://ibm.biz/es-cr-samples). You can configure and apply them by using the [command line](../installing/#installing-an-instance-by-using-the-cli) or by dragging and dropping them onto the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} [web console](../installing/#installing-by-using-the-yaml-view), and editing them.

## Checking configuration settings

This page gives information about many configuration options. To see further information about specific configuration options, or to see what options are available, you can use the `oc explain` command. To see information about a specific field, run the following:

`oc explain eventstreams.<path-of-field>`

Where `path-of-field` is the JSON path of the field of interest.

For example, if you want to see more information about configuring external listeners for Kafka you can run the following command:

`oc explain eventstreams.spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.listeners.external`

## Enabling persistent storage

If you want your data to be preserved in the event of a restart, configure persistent storage for Kafka, ZooKeeper, and Schema Registry in your {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} installation.

**Note:** Ensure you have sufficient [disk space](../capacity-planning/#disk-space-for-persistent-volumes) for persistent storage.

These settings are specified in the YAML configuration document that defines an instance of the `EventStreams` custom resource and can be applied when defining a new {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance under the "IBM Event Streams" operator in the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} web console.

- To enable persistent storage for Kafka, add the `storage` property under `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka`
- To enable persistent storage for ZooKeeper, add the `storage` property under `spec.strimziOverrides.zookeeper`
- To enable persistent storage for Schema Registry, add the `storage` property under `spec.schemaRegistry`

Complete the configuration by adding additional fields to these storage properties as follows:

1. Specify the storage type in `storage.type` (for example, `"ephemeral"` or `"persistent-claim"`).

   **Note:** When using ephemeral storage, ensure you set retention limits for Kafka topics so that you do not run out of disk space.
   If [message retention](../../getting-started/creating-topics/) is set to long periods and the message volume is high, the storage requirements for the topics could impact the OpenShift nodes that host the Kafka pods, and cause the nodes to run out of allocated disk space, which could impact normal operation.

2. Specify the storage size in `storage.size` (for example, `"100Gi"`).
3. Optionally, specify the storage class in `storage.class` (for example, `"rook-ceph-block-internal"`).
4. Optionally, specify the retention setting for the storage if the cluster is deleted in `storage.deleteClaim` (for example, `"true"`).

An example of these configuration options:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
# ...
spec:
  schemaRegistry:
    # ...
    storage:
      type: "persistent-claim"
      size: "10Gi"
      class: "cephfs"
  strimziOverrides:
    kafka:
      # ...
      storage:
        type: "persistent-claim"
        size: "100Gi"
        class: "ceph-block"
    zookeeper:
      # ...
      storage:
        type: "persistent-claim"
        size: "100Gi"
        class: "ceph-block"
# ...
```

If present, existing persistent volumes with the specified storage class are used after installation, or if a [dynamic provisioner](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/storage/dynamic-provisioning.html){:target="_blank"} is configured for the specified storage class, new persistent volumes are created.

Where optional values are not specified:

- If no storage class is specified and a default storage class has been defined in the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} settings, the default storage class will be used.
- If no storage class is specified and no default storage class has been defined in the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} settings, the deployment will use any [persistent volume claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) that have at least the set size value.
- If no retention setting is provided, the storage will be retained when the cluster is deleted.

The following example YAML document shows an example `EventStreams` custom resource with dynamically allocated storage provided using CephFS for Kafka and ZooKeeper. To try this deployment, set the required `namespace` and accept the license by changing the `spec.license.accept` value to `"true"`.

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
metadata:
  name: example-storage
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  license:
    accept: false
  version: 10.0.0
  adminApi: {}
  adminUI: {}
  collector: {}
  restProducer: {}
  schemaRegistry:
    storage:
      type: ephemeral
  strimziOverrides:
    kafka:
      replicas: 1
      config:
        interceptor.class.names: com.ibm.eventstreams.interceptors.metrics.ProducerMetricsInterceptor
        offsets.topic.replication.factor: 1
        transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
        transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1
      listeners:
        external:
          type: route
        plain: {}
        tls: {}
      storage:
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 100Gi
        class: rook-ceph-block-internal
        deleteClaim: true
      metrics: {}
    zookeeper:
      replicas: 1
      storage:
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 100Gi
        class: rook-ceph-block-internal
      deleteClaim: true
      metrics: {}
```

## Configuring encryption between pods

Pod-to-Pod encryption is enabled by default for all {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} pods. Unless explicitly overridden in an `EventStreams` custom resource, the configuration option `spec.security.internalTls` will be set to `TLSv1.2`. This value can be set to `NONE` which will disable Pod-to-Pod encryption.

For example, the following YAML snippet disables encryption between pods:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
metadata:
  name: example-internal-disabled
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  # ...
  security:
    # ...
    internalTls: NONE
# ...
```

## Configuring UI Security

By default, accessing the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI requires an {{site.data.reuse.icpcs}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) user that has been assigned access to {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} (see [managing access](../../security/managing-access/#accessing-the-event-streams-ui-and-cli) for details).

The login requirement for the UI is _disabled_ when all Kafka authentication and authorization is disabled. This is demonstrated by the proof-of-concept [**lightweight without security**](../planning/#development-deployments) sample.

**Important:** This configuration will limit UI capability due to the security requirements of other components. The following features will be disabled:

- Geo-replication
- Metrics panel
- Producers panel
- Connect to schema
- Connect to cluster
- Connect to topic

## Applying Kafka broker configuration settings

Kafka supports a number of [broker configuration settings](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs), typically provided in a properties file.

When creating an instance of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}, these settings are defined in an `EventStreams` custom resource under a the `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.config` property.

The following example uses Kafka broker settings to configure replication for system topics:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
metadata:
  name: example-broker-config
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  # ...
  strimziOverrides:
    # ...
    kafka:
      # ...
      config:
        offsets.topic.replication.factor: 1
        transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
        transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1
```

This custom resource can be created using the `oc` command or the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} web console under the **IBM Event Streams** operator page.

You can specify all the broker configuration options supported by Kafka except from those managed directly by {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}. For further information, see the list of [supported configuration options](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/0.19.0/using.html#ref-kafka-broker-configuration-deployment-configuration-kafka){:target="_blank"}.

After deployment, these settings can be [modified](../../administering/modifying-installation/#modifying-kafka-broker-configuration-settings) by updating the `EventStreams` custom resource.

## Applying Kafka rack awareness

Kafka rack awareness is configured by setting the `rack` property in the `EventStreams` custom resource using the zone label as the topology key in the `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.rack` field. This key needs to match the [zone label](../preparing-multizone/#zone-awareness) name applied to the nodes.

**Note:** Before this is applied, ensure the [Kafka cluster role](../preparing-multizone/#kafka-rack-awareness) for rack awareness has been applied.

The following example sets the `rack` topologyKey to `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone`:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
metadata:
  name: example-broker-config
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  # ...
  strimziOverrides:
    # ...
    kafka:
      # ...
      rack:
        topologyKey: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
      # ...
```

## Setting geo-replication nodes

You can install geo-replication in a cluster to enable messages to be automatically synchronized between local and remote topics. A cluster can be a geo-replication origin or destination. Origin clusters send messages to a remote system, while destination clusters receive messages from a remote system. A cluster can be both an origin and a destination cluster at the same time.

To enable geo-replication, create an `EventStreamsGeoReplicator` custom resource alongside the `EventStreams` custom resource. This can be defined in a YAML configuration document under the **IBM Event Streams** operator in the {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} web console.

When setting up geo-replication, consider the [number of geo-replication worker nodes (replicas)](../../georeplication/planning/#preparing-a-destination-cluster) to deploy and configure this in the `spec.replicas` property.

Ensure that the following properties match the name of the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance:

- `metadata.name`
- `metadata.labels["eventstreams.ibm.com/cluster"]`

For example, to configure geo-replication with `2` replicas for an {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance called `sample-three` in the namespace `myproject`, create the following `EventStreamsGeoReplicator` configuration:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreamsGeoReplicator
metadata:
  labels:
    eventstreams.ibm.com/cluster: sample-three
  name: sample-three
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  # ...
  replicas: 2
```

**Note:** Geo-replication can be deployed or reconfigured at any time. For more information, see [Setting up geo-replication](../../georeplication/setting-up/).

## Configuring access

External access using {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} routes is automatically configured for the following services if they are included in the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} installation:

- The {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI
- The Schema Registry
- The Admin API
- The REST Producer

### REST services access

The REST services for {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} are configured with defaults for the container port, type, TLS version, certificates, and authentication mechanisms. If the Kafka listeners have been configured without authentication requirements then the authentication mechanisms are automatically removed from the REST endpoints.

The schema for REST endpoint configuration is described in the following table, followed by an example of an endpoint configuration for the Admin API. In the example, the potential values for `<component>` in `spec.<component>.endpoints` are:

- `adminApi` for the Admin API
- `restProducer` for the REST Producer
- `schemaRegistry` for the Schema Registry

```

# ...
spec:
  # ...
  adminApi:
    # ...
    endpoints:
      - name: example
        containerPort: 9080
        type: route
        tlsVersion: TLSv1.2
        authenticationMechanisms:
          - iam-bearer
          - tls
          - scram-sha-512
        certOverrides:
            certificate: mycert.crt
            key: mykey.key
            secretName: custom-endpoint-cert
        host: example-host.apps.example-domain.com
```

**Note:** Changing an endpoint in isolation might have adverse effects if Kafka is configured to require authentication and the configured endpoint has no authentication mechanisms specified. In such cases, a warning message might be displayed in the instance status conditions.

The {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} REST components also allow for the default set of cipher suites to be overridden. Though not a recommended practice, it is possible to enable alternative cipher suites to facilitate connectivity of legacy systems. This capability is provided through the `CIPHER_SUITES` environment variable as shown in this example:

```
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  restProducer:
    # ...
    env:
      - name: CIPHER_SUITES
        value: >-
          TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
```

### Kafka access

All examples provided for {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} include an external listener for Kafka and varying internal listener types by default. The supported external listener is of type `route`. This indicates the use of an {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} route, and it can have either `tls` or `scram-sha-512` configured as the authentication mechanisms.

The following example snippet defines an external listener that exposes the Kafka brokers using an {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} route with SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication enabled.

```
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  strimziOverrides:
    # ...
    kafka:
      listeners:
        external:
          type: route
          authentication:
            type: scram-sha-512
```

Internal listeners for Kafka can also be configured. In addition to the `external` listener, there are `plain` and `tls` internal listeners. Each of these can be configured to have an authentication mechanism as shown in the following example.

```
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  strimziOverrides:
    # ...
    kafka:
      listeners:
        plain:
          authentication:
            type: scram-sha-512
        tls:
          authentication:
            type: tls
```

The Kafka listener security protocols are mapped to the internal listener configurations as shown in the following table:

| Security protocol           | Listener configuration                                                           |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PLAINTEXT                   | `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.listeners.plain: {}`                                |
| SSL (no-authentication)     | `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.listeners.tls: {}`                                  |
| SSL (mutual-authentication) | `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.listeners.tls.authentication.type: tls`             |
| SASL_PLAINTEXT              | `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.listeners.plain.authentication.type: scram-sha-512` |
| SASL_SSL                    | `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.listeners.tls.authentication.type: scram-sha-512`   |

## Configuring external monitoring through Prometheus

Metrics provide information about the health and operation of the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance.

Metrics can be enabled for Kafka, ZooKeeper, geo-replicator, and Kafka Connect pods.

**Note:** Kafka metrics can also be exposed externally through JMX by [configuring external monitoring tools](#configuring-external-monitoring-through-jmx).

Kafka metrics can be enabled by setting `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.metrics` to `{}` in the `EventStreams` custom resource. For example:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
# ...
spec:
  strimziOverrides:
    kafka:
      # ...
      metrics: {}
# ...
```

ZooKeeper metrics can be enabled by setting `spec.strimziOverrides.zookeeper.metrics` to `{}` in the `EventStreams` custom resource. For example:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
# ...
spec:
  strimziOverrides:
    zookeeper:
      # ...
      metrics: {}
# ...
```

Geo-replicator metrics can be enabled by setting `spec.metrics` to `{}` in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource. For example:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  metrics: {}
# ...
```

**Note:** The {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} operator automatically applies a `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource when a `EventStreamsGeoReplicator` custom resource is created. Metrics can then be enabled by editing the generated `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource.

Kafka Connect metrics can be enabled by setting `spec.metrics` to `{}` in the `KafkaConnectS2I` custom resource. For example:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: KafkaConnectS2I
# ...
spec:
  # ...
  metrics: {}
# ...
```

To complement the default Kafka metrics, {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} can be configured to publish additional information about the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance by setting the `spec.strimziOverrides.kafka.config.interceptor.class.name` to `com.ibm.eventstreams.interceptors.metrics.ProducerMetricsInterceptor`, for example:

```
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: EventStreams
# ...
spec:
  strimziOverrides:
    kafka:
      # ...
        config:
          # ...
          interceptor.class.names: com.ibm.eventstreams.interceptors.metrics.ProducerMetricsInterceptor
# ...
```

**Note:** For details about viewing metrics information, see the [cluster health](../administering/cluster-health) and [topic health](../administering/topic-health) sections.

## Configuring external monitoring through JMX

You can use third-party monitoring tools to monitor the deployed {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} Kafka cluster by collecting Kafka metrics. To set this up, you need to:

- Have a third-party monitoring tool set up to be used within your {{site.data.reuse.openshift_short}} cluster.
- Enable access to the broker JMX port by setting `spec.strimizOverrides.kafka.jmxOptions`.
  ```
  apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
  kind: EventStreams
  # ...
  spec:
    # ...
    strimziOverrides:
      # ...
      kafka:
        jmxOptions: {}
  ```
- Include any configuration settings for {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} as required by your monitoring tool. For example, Datadog's autodiscovery requires you to annotate Kafka broker pods (`strimziOverrides.kafka.template.statefulset.metadata.annotations`)
- Configure your monitoring applications to [consume JMX metrics](../../security/secure-jmx-connections/).

## Configuring the Kafka Exporter

You can configure the Kafka Exporter to expose additional metrics to Prometheus on top of the default ones. For example, you can obtain the consumer group lag information for each topic.

The Kafka Exporter can be configured using a `regex` to expose metrics for a collection of topics and consumer groups that match the expression. For example, to enable JMX metrics collection for the topic `orders` and the group `buyers`, configure the `EventStreams` custom resource as follows:

```
  apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
  kind: EventStreams
  # ...
  spec:
  # ...
  strimziOverrides:
    # ...
    kafkaExporter:
      groupRegex: orders
      topicRegex: buyers
      template:
        pod:
          metadata:
            annotations:

## Configuring the JMX Exporter

You can configure the JMX Exporter to expose JMX metrics from Kafka brokers, ZooKeeper nodes, and Kafka Connect nodes to Prometheus.

To enable the collection of all JMX metrics available on the Kafka brokers and ZooKeeper nodes, configure the `EventStreams` custom resource as follows:

```
  apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
  kind: EventStreams
  # ...
  spec:
  # ...
  strimziOverrides:
    kafka:
      metrics: {}
      # ...
    zookeepers:
      #
    # ...
```

For more information about configuration options, see the following documentation:

- [Kafka JMX metrics configuration](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/0.19.0/using.html#assembly-metrics-deployment-configuration-kafka-connect){:target="_blank"}

## Using your own certificates

{{site.data.reuse.short_name}} offers the capability to provide your own CA certificates and private keys instead of using the ones generated by the operator.

**Note:** You must complete the process of providing your own certificates before installing an instance of {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}.

You must provide your own X.509 certificates and keys in PEM format with the addition of a PKCS12-formatted certificate and the CA password. If you want to use a CA which is not a Root CA, you have to include the whole chain in the certificate file. The chain should be in the following order:

1. The cluster or clients CA
2. One or more intermediate CAs
3. The root CA

All CAs in the chain should be configured as a CA with the X509v3 Basic Constraints.

**Note:** In the following instructions, the CA public certificate file is denoted `CA.crt` and the CA private key is denoted `CA.key`.

As {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} also serves the `truststore` in PKCS12 format, generate a `.p12` file containing the relevant CA Certificates. When generating your PKCS12 truststore, ensure that the truststore does not contain the CA private key. This is important because the `.p12` file will be available to download from the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI and distributed to clients.

The following is an example showing how to use the Java `keytool` utility to generate a PKCS12 truststore that does not contain a private key: \\
\\
`keytool -import -file <ca.pem> -keystore ca.jks` \\
`keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore ca.jks -srcstoretype JKS -deststoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore ca.p12`

**Note:** Using OpenSSL PKCS12 commands to generate a truststore without private keys can break the cluster, because the resulting truststore is not compatible with Java runtimes.\\
One way to test that the truststore is compatible and contains the correct certificates is to use the following java `keytool` utility command: \\
\\
`keytool -list -keystore ca.p12 -storepass <keystore password>`

The cluster and/or clients certificates, and keys must be added to secrets in the namespace that the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance is intended to be created in. The naming of the secrets and required labels must follow the conventions detailed in the following command templates.

The following four commands can be used to create and label the secrets for custom certificates and keys. The templates demonstrate providing cluster certificates but the same commands can be re-used substituting `cluster` with `clients` in each secret name.

For each command, provide the intended name and namespace for the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance.

`oc create --namespace <namespace> secret generic <instance-name>-cluster-ca --from-file=ca.key=CA.key`

`oc label --namespace <namespace> secret <instance-name>-cluster-ca eventstreams.ibm.com/kind=Kafka eventstreams.ibm.com/cluster=<instance-name>`

`oc create --namespace <namespace> secret generic <instance-name>-cluster-ca-cert --from-file=ca.crt=CA.crt --from-file=ca.p12=CA.p12 --from-literal=ca.password='<CA_PASSWORD>'`

`oc label --namespace <namespace> secret <instance-name>-cluster-ca-cert eventstreams.ibm.com/kind=Kafka eventstreams.ibm.com/cluster=<instance-name>`

To make use of the provided secrets, {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} will require the following overrides to be added to the custom resource.

```
spec:
  # ...
  strimziOverrides:
    clusterCa:
      generateCertificateAuthority: false

  # And/Or

    clientsCa:
      generateCertificateAuthority: false
```

It is also possible to configure the `renewalDays` (default 30) and `validityDays` (default 365) under the `spec.strimziOverrides.clusterCa` and `spec.strimziOverrides.clientsCa` keys. Validity periods are expressed as a number of days after certificate generation.
