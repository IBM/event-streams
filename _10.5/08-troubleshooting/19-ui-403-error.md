## Symptoms

Signing into the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI fails with the message `403 Not authorized`, indicating that the user does not have permission to access the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance.

## Causes

To access the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI, the user must either have the `Cluster Administrator` role or the `Administrator` role and be in a team with a namespace resource added for the namespace containing the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} instance. If neither of these applies, the error will be displayed.

## Resolving the problem

[Assign access to users](../../security/managing-access/#assigning-access-to-users) with an `Administrator` role by ensuring they are in a team with access to the correct namespace.
