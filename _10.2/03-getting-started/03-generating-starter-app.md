To learn more about how to create applications that can take advantage of {{site.data.reuse.long_name}} capabilities, you can use the starter application. The starter application can produce and consume messages, and you can specify the topic to send messages to and the contents of the message.

## About the application
The starter application provides a demonstration of a Java application that uses the [Vert.x Kafka Client](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-kafka-client/java/){:target="_blank"} to send events to, and receive events from, {{site.data.reuse.short_name}}. It also includes a user interface to easily view message propagation. The source code is provided in [GitHub](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/kafka-java-vertx-starter){:target="_blank"} to allow you to understand the elements required to create your own Kafka application.

## Downloading the application
If you do not already have the application, download the JAR file from the {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} UI.
1. {{site.data.reuse.es_ui_login_nonadmin}}
2. Click the **Try the starter application** tile, or click **Toolbox** in the primary navigation, go to the **Starter application** section, and click **Get started**.
3. Click **Download JAR from GitHub**.
4. Download the JAR file for the latest release.

## Generate security and configuration files
Before you can run the application, generate security and configuration files to connect to your {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} and the target topic.

Some of the following steps depend on your [access permissions](../../security/managing-access/). If you are not permitted to generate credentials you will not see the **Generate properties** button and will have to obtain security and configuration files from your administrator before running the application. If you are not permitted to create topics, you will not be able to create a topic as part of this lesson and will have to use a pre-existing topic.

1. From the **Starter application** menu opened in [the previous step](#downloading-the-application), click **Generate properties** to open the side panel.
2. Enter an application name in the **Starter application name** field. This value is used by {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} to create a `KafkaUser`, which will provide your application with credentials to connect to {{site.data.reuse.short_name}} securely.
   **Note:** This name must be unique to avoid potential clashes with pre-existing KafkaUser resources.

3. Select a new or existing topic to connect to.
   **Note:** When creating a new topic the name must be unique to avoid potential clashes with pre-existing topics.
4. Click the **Generate and download .zip** button to download the compressed file, then extract the contents to your preferred location.

## Running the application

Before running the application, ensure you have the following available:
1. The application [JAR file](#downloading-the-application).
2. A directory containing [security and configuration files](#generate-security-and-configuration-files)

Run the following command to start the application:

```
java -Dproperties_path=<configuration_properties_path> -jar <jar_path>/demo-all.jar
```

Where:
- `configuration_properties_path` is the path to the directory containing the extracted security and configuration files.
- `jar_path` is the path to the downloaded application JAR file.

Wait for the application to be ready. It will print out the following message:
```
Application started in Xms
```

When the application is ready, access the UI by using the following URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Use the start button in the UI to produce messages and see them consumed.
